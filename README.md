# Project generator shell scripts written in bash

Scripts that I use to generate my projects. They automatically do the tedious stuff for me.

### Post script execution instructions for git / GitHub (optional)

- [1] install github-cli package _(Varies by OS)_
- [2] gh auth login _(Follow instructions once command is executed, then proceed)_
- [3] git add .
- [4] git commit -m "init" _(First time project creation)_
- [5] git remote add origin _<url>_.git
- [6] git push -u origin master _(Yours might be "main", but mine is configured to be "master")_
